This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("tidycensus")
```


```{r}
plot(cars)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
Clean_MD_Cases_By_County<-MD_COVID_19_Cases_by_County %>% 
  clean_names() 
  
```


```{r}
library(lubridate)
```


Was having a slight issue with my mutate, asked ChatGPT
```{r}
Clean_MD_Cases_By_County <- Clean_MD_Cases_By_County %>%
  mutate(date = mdy_hms(date) %>% date())
```

Let's try to measure if we had a rise in November, specifically in the aftermath of Thanksgiving
```{r}
November_Cases <- Clean_MD_Cases_By_County %>%
  filter(month(date) == 11)
```


```{r}
November_Cases %>% 
  rowwise () %>% 
  mutate(total_cases = sum(c_across(-c(objectid, date)),na.rm = TRUE))
```
```{r}
November_Cases %>% 
  mutate(Thanksgiving change = )
```
